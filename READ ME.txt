To run this project, you must put the "ELearningDatabase" and both "derby" and "derby.properties" inside  your NetBeans > Derby Files.
If you couldn't find the file, you can open NetBeans and go to Services, right click Java DB to check the properties and see where the file is located.

Once you have put both file inside, open your NetBeans and connect it to the Database first, it can be find under JavaDB.

Onace you have connect, you are good to go! Thank you.
